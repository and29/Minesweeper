#Minesweeper
This is a simple minesweeper game. There are a few options from the menu bar such as difficulty or size.

It has been done only using native Java swing objects. As an example, each cell is represented with a JButton. The result looks nice on the Mac OSX JVM.

The folder contains :

*	The runnable application as a JAR
*	The runnaple OSX app in a zip file
*	All source code in Minesweeper folder
